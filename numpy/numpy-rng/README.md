# NumPy Random Number Generation

This folder contains supplementary code for the Real Python tutorial on [NumPy's pseudo-random number generator](https://realpython.com/numpy-random-number-generator/). You can copy the code examples, or continue your learning by experimenting more with them.

## Setup

Create and activate a virtual environment, then install the requirements:

```bash
$ python -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
(venv) $ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt -c constraints.txt
```

For most of the examples, you only need a version of NumPy>=1.17 installed, but you'll use `matplotlib` and `scipy` in the final section of the tutorial.

## Usage

After creating and activating your virtual environment, and installing the dependencies, you should be able to run each individual file normally:

```bash
(venv) $ python filename.py
```

You can find more information and context on the code blocks in [Using the NumPy Random Number Generator](https://realpython.com/numpy-random-number-generator/).
